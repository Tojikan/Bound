Bound Game v0.03

- Early prototype of a game designed to recreate Starcraft bounds into a mobile game.
- Following the prototype completion, game was decided to be redesigned from the ground up so this version is abandoned.
- The game is fully playable and can be built and run from Unity as a standalone PC version. 
- To play the game, Build and Run from Unity using PC settings. Or simply play it in Play Mode in Unity.
- If playing on a standalone build, remember to copy the /Assets/Maps directory to a /Assets/Maps directory in the final build version.
- The game only reads maps from a /Assets/Maps directory


Features
- Early map editor is built in the Map Editor Scene for developing your own bound maps. Check out the github wiki for more info
- All maps are loaded from .bound files in a folder located in the Assets. The game will auto read the directory and load maps
- All features are implemented on a basic level in the game.
- Touch and mouse controls. However, trying to use touch controls in a PC build will not work. Disregard the control schemes in the menu if you're on PC



Will possibly be developed in the future but for now will focus on the simplified redesign version for mobile as of 5/2018.
