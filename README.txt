Bound Game v0.03

- Early prototype of a game designed to recreate Starcraft bounds into a mobile game.
- The game is fully playable and can be built and run from Unity as a standalone PC version. 
- To play the game, Build and Run from Unity using PC settings. Or simply play it in Play Mode in Unity.
- If playing on a standalone build, remember to copy the /Assets/Maps directory to a /Assets/Maps directory in the final build version.
- The game only reads map files that are located in the /Assets/Maps directory


Features
- Early map editor is built in the Map Editor Scene for developing your own bound maps. Check out the github wiki for more info
- All maps are loaded from .bound files in a folder located in the Assets. The game will auto read the directory and load maps
- All features are implemented on a basic level in the game.
- Touch and mouse controls. However, trying to use touch controls in a PC build will not work. Disregard the control schemes in the menu if you're on PC



Will possibly be completed later, but for now will focus on redesinging into a game that does not require so many art assets.
